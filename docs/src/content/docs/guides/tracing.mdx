The Agents SDK includes built-in tracing, collecting a comprehensive record of events during an agent
run: LLM generations, tool calls, handoffs, guardrails, and even custom events that occur. Using the
[Traces dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/traces), you can debug, visualize, and monitor your
workflows during development and in production.

<Aside type="note">

Tracing is enabled by default. There are two ways to disable tracing:

1. You can globally disable tracing by setting the env var `OPENAI_AGENTS_DISABLE_TRACING=1`
2. You can disable tracing for a single run by setting [`RunConfig.tracingDisabled`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents-core/type-aliases/runconfig/#tracingdisabled) to `true`

**_For organizations operating under a Zero Data Retention (ZDR) policy using OpenAI's APIs, tracing is unavailable._**

## Traces and spans

- **Traces** represent a single end-to-end operation of a "workflow". They're composed of Spans. Traces have the following properties:
  - `workflow_name`: This is the logical workflow or app. For example "Code generation" or "Customer service".
  - `trace_id`: A unique ID for the trace. Automatically generated if you don't pass one. Must have the format `trace_<32_alphanumeric>`.
  - `group_id`: Optional group ID, to link multiple traces from the same conversation. For example, you might use a chat thread ID.
  - `disabled`: If True, the trace will not be recorded.
  - `metadata`: Optional metadata for the trace.
- **Spans** represent operations that have a start and end time. Spans have:
  - `started_at` and `ended_at` timestamps.
  - `trace_id`, to represent the trace they belong to
  - `parent_id`, which points to the parent Span of this Span (if any)
  - `span_data`, which is information about the Span. For example, `AgentSpanData` contains information about the Agent, `GenerationSpanData` contains information about the LLM generation, etc.

## Default tracing

By default, the SDK traces the following:

- The entire `run()` or `Runner.run()` is wrapped in a `Trace`.
- Each time an agent runs, it is wrapped in `AgentSpan`
- LLM generations are wrapped in `GenerationSpan`
- Function tool calls are each wrapped in `FunctionSpan`
- Guardrails are wrapped in `GuardrailSpan`
- Handoffs are wrapped in `HandoffSpan`

By default, the trace is named "Agent workflow". You can set this name if you use `withTrace`, or you can can configure the name and other properties with the [`RunConfig.workflowName`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents-core/type-aliases/runconfig/#workflowname).

In addition, you can set up [custom trace processors](#custom-tracing-processors) to push traces to other destinations (as a replacement, or secondary destination).

### Voice agent tracing

If you are using `RealtimeAgent` and `RealtimeSession` with the default OpenAI Realtime API, tracing will automatically happen on the Realtime API side unless you disable it on the `RealtimeSession` using `tracingDisabled: true` or using the `OPENAI_AGENTS_DISABLE_TRACING` environment variable.

Check out the [Voice agents guide](/openai-agents-js/guides/voice-agents) for more details.

## Higher level traces

Sometimes, you might want multiple calls to `run()` to be part of a single trace. You can do this by wrapping the entire code in a `withTrace()`.

<Code lang="typescript" code={customTraceExample} />

1. Because the two calls to `run` are wrapped in a `withTrace()`, the individual runs will be part of the overall trace rather than creating two traces.

## Creating traces

You can use the [`withTrace()`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents-core/functions/withtrace/) function to create a trace. Alternatively, you can use `getGlobalTraceProvider().createTrace()` to create a new trace manually and pass it into `withTrace()`.

The current trace is tracked via a [Node.js `AsyncLocalStorage`](https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html#class-asynclocalstorage) or the respective environment polyfills. This means that it works with concurrency automatically.

## Creating spans

You can use the various `create*Span()` (e.g. `createGenerationSpan()`, `createFunctionSpan()`, etc.) methods to create a span. In general, you don't need to manually create spans. A [`createCustomSpan()`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents-core/functions/createcustomspan/) function is available for tracking custom span information.

Spans are automatically part of the current trace, and are nested under the nearest current span, which is tracked via a [Node.js `AsyncLocalStorage`](https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html#class-asynclocalstorage) or the respective environment polyfills.

## Sensitive data

Certain spans may capture potentially sensitive data.

The `createGenerationSpan()` stores the inputs/outputs of the LLM generation, and `createFunctionSpan()` stores the inputs/outputs of function calls. These may contain sensitive data, so you can disable capturing that data via [`RunConfig.traceIncludeSensitiveData
`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents-core/type-aliases/runconfig/#traceincludesensitivedata).

## Custom tracing processors

The high level architecture for tracing is:

- At initialization, we create a global [`TraceProvider`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents-core/classes/traceprovider), which is responsible for creating traces and can be accessed through [`getGlobalTraceProvider()`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents-core/functions/getglobaltraceprovider/).
- We configure the `TraceProvider` with a [`BatchTraceProcessor`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents-core/classes/batchtraceprocessor/) that sends traces/spans in batches to a [`OpenAITracingExporter`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents-openai/classes/openaitracingexporter/), which exports the spans and traces to the OpenAI backend in batches.

To customize this default setup, to send traces to alternative or additional backends or modifying exporter behavior, you have two options:

1. [`addTraceProcessor()`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents-core/functions/addtraceprocessor) lets you add an **additional** trace processor that will receive traces and spans as they are ready. This lets you do your own processing in addition to sending traces to OpenAI's backend.
2. [`setTraceProcessors()`](/openai-agents-js/openai/agents-core/functions/settraceprocessors) lets you **replace** the default processors with your own trace processors. This means traces will not be sent to the OpenAI backend unless you include a `TracingProcessor` that does so.
