<Aside type="caution">
  This adapter is still in beta. You may run into issues with some model
  providers, especially smaller ones. Please report any issues via [GitHub
  issues](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-js/issues) and we'll fix
  quickly.
</Aside>

Out of the box the Agents SDK works with OpenAI models through the Responses API or Chat
Completions API. However, if you would like to use another model, the [Vercel's AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/) offers a range
of supported models that can be brought into the Agents SDK through this adapter.

## Setup

<Steps>

1. Install the AI SDK adapter by installing the extensions package:

   ```bash
   npm install @openai/agents-extensions
   ```

2. Choose your desired model package from the [Vercel's AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/models/overview) and install it:

   ```bash
   npm install @ai-sdk/openai
   ```

3. Import the adapter and model to connect to your agent:

   ```typescript
   import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
   import { aisdk } from '@openai/agents-extensions';
   ```

4. Initialize an instance of the model to be used by the agent:

   ```typescript
   const model = aisdk(openai('o4-mini'));
   ```
