  //    Hi! Iâ€™m about to tell you 7 jokes. Ready? Here we go:
  //
  //   1. Why don't skeletons fight each other? They don't have the guts!
  //
  //   2. Parallel lines have so much in common. It's a shame they'll never meet.
  //
  //   3. Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field!
  //
  //   4. Why can't you give Elsa a balloon? Because she will let it go!
  //
  //   5. Why did the golfer bring two pairs of pants? In case he got a hole in one!
  //
  //   6. I told my wife she was drawing her eyebrows too high. She looked surprised.
  //
  //   7. Why are elevator jokes so classic and good? They work on many levels!
  //
  //   Hope that made you smile! Would you like a few more, or is there anything else I can do for you?
  //   === Run complete ===
