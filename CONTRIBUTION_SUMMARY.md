- `examples/basic/performance-monitoring.ts` - Performance monitoring examples
- `examples/docs/practical-patterns/streaming-patterns.ts` - Streaming patterns

### New Documentation

- `docs/troubleshooting/mcp-issues.md` - MCP troubleshooting guide
- `docs/troubleshooting/streaming-issues.md` - Streaming troubleshooting guide
- `docs/troubleshooting/README.md` - Troubleshooting overview

### New Tests

- `packages/agents-core/test/performance.test.ts` - Performance monitoring tests

### Package Changes

- `.changeset/developer-utilities-enhancement.md` - Changeset describing new features

## Key Features

### Performance Monitoring

```typescript
import {
  PerformanceEnhancedRunner,
  createSimplePerformanceMonitor,
} from '@openai/agents-core/performance';

const monitor = createSimplePerformanceMonitor();
const runner = new PerformanceEnhancedRunner({}, monitor);

const result = await runner.run(agent, 'Your query here');
const reports = monitor.getReports();
```

### Retry Patterns

```typescript
import { RetryPattern, CircuitBreaker } from './retry-patterns';

const retryPattern = new RetryPattern(3, 1000, 5000);
const result = await retryPattern.execute(async () => {
  return await agent.run('Your query here');
});
```

### Streaming Patterns

```typescript
import { RealTimeChatInterface } from './streaming-patterns';

const chatInterface = new RealTimeChatInterface();
chatInterface.on('messageChunk', (data) => {
  console.log('Received:', data.content);
});

await chatInterface.sendMessage('Hello!', 'user1');
```

## Testing

All new functionality includes comprehensive tests:

- Performance monitoring utilities tested with various scenarios
- Retry patterns tested with failure simulation
- Streaming patterns tested with interruption handling
- MCP improvements tested with connection failures

## Backward Compatibility

All enhancements maintain full backward compatibility:

- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- New features are opt-in through separate imports
- Existing code continues to work without modification

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation includes:

- API documentation for all new utilities
- Practical examples for common use cases
- Troubleshooting guides for common issues
- Best practices for production usage

## Benefits for Developers
